Log Components
==============

Log component is a useful feature of ns-3 to filter out unwanted debug
information during execution. In this project, each object has its own
homonymous log component, except for scenarios which have a unique log
component named ``Scenario``.

.. note::
    Beware that additional components are available, but are provided by ns-3
    authors. Please read `their documentation
    <https://www.nsnam.org/docs/manual/html/logging.html>`_ for more
    information.
